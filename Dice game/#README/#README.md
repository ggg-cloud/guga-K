This is a responsive dice game with an attractive design and a smooth playing experience, suitable for playing on phones, tablets, or computers. The rules are simple:

To play, you need to roll the dice. 
If the dice shows a 6, your current score will be six. 
Then, you roll the dice again, and if the next dice shows a 4, your current score becomes 6 + 4 = 10. 
In this way, you accumulate points.

However, be careful! 
If you decide not to hold your score and you roll a 1, your current score will be lost, and it will be the next player's turn. 
Rolling a 1 means you lose your current score.

On the other hand, if you choose to hold your score, it will be the next player's turn, but your current score will be added to your overall score.
